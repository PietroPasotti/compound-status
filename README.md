In complex charms that have multiple parallel duties, we often see that it is not enough to know if the charm as a whole is `active/blocked/waiting/...`; charmers search for ways to track multiple statuses independently. We want to tell the user: 'the charm as a whole is blocked, because this part is blocked, that other part is waiting, and that other part over there is doing maintenance'.
That is, we want a taxonomy of statuses.

The first step to get there is to allow charmers to define the status as a pool of independently-trackable statuses that can be associated with tasks, components, integrations, or (why not) individual relations.

# What this is

This charm lib exposes utilities to create 'status pools'. 
```python
from compound_status import *

class MyPool(StatusPool):
    """This defines my charm's status pool."""
    workload = Status()  # this tracks the workload status
    relation_1 = Status()  # this tracks my integration #1
    relation_2 = Status()  # this tracks my integration #2

    
class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, framework, key=None):
        super().__init__(framework, key)
        status_pool = MyPool(self)

        status_pool.relation_1 = ActiveStatus('‚úÖ')
        status_pool.commit()  # sync with juju
        
        status_pool.relation_1.unset()  # send status_1 back to unknown, until you set it again. 
        
        status_pool.relation_2 = WaitingStatus('ùåó: foo')
        status_pool.workload.warning('found something weird')
        status_pool.workload.info('attempting to work around...')
        status_pool.workload.error('whoopsiedaisies!')
        status_pool.workload = BlockedStatus('üíî')
        status_pool.commit()   
``` 

Juju status will display:

`tst/0*  blocked   idle   <IP>   (workload) üíî`

Only the 'worst' status is displayed.
The logging message, tagged with `['workload']`, will be visible in `juju debug-log`.

## Priority

To disambiguate when you have multiple 'just as bad' statuses, the concept of `priority` comes into play.
By default, the order of definition of the Statuses in the pool determines their priority:
from top to bottom = from most important to least important.
Example:

```python
from compound_status import *
class MyPool(StatusPool):
    relation_1 = Status()       # priority 1
    relation_2 = Status()       # priority 2
    relation_3 = Status()       # priority 3
    workload = Status()         # priority 4
    relation_4 = Status()       # priority 5
```

In this case, if all are active except `relation_3` and `workload`, which are both `blocked`, only the status for `relation_3` will be shown, because it has been defined first and has therefore implicitly priority 3.

To allow more flexibility (subclassing, whatnot), you can also manually pass priorities to the Statuses, like so:

```python
from compound_status import *
class MyPool(StatusPool):
    SKIP_UNKNOWN = True

    relation_1 = Status(priority=12)
    relation_2 = Status(priority=10)
    relation_3 = Status(priority=62)
    workload = Status(priority=40)
    relation_4 = Status(priority=1)
```

In this case, if `relation_3` has lower priority than `workload`, so if both are blocked `workload` will take precedence.

Caveats:
 - you can't mix 'manual' and 'auto' priority modes: either you pass `priority:int` to each and every status, or to none at all.
 - You have to ensure yourself that no two Statuses have the same priority. In that case, the precedence will be (presumably) random.


## Dynamically defining Statuses

Having statically defined Statuses is nice because you get code completion, type hints, and so on, but sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes you want to use statuses to track intrinsically dynamic things, such as many relations attached to an endpoint. Every time a unit joins, you want to track the status of the relation with that remote in a separate status. For that purpose, we offer 
 -`StatusPool.add_status` to add and start tracking a new status
 -`StatusPool.get_status` to grab an existing status by name (alias to `getattr`)
 -`StatusPool.set_status` to set a status by name (alias to `setattr`)
 -`StatusPool.remove_status` to remove (forget) an existing status 

Example usage (pseudocody):

```python
from compound_status import *
from ops.charm import RelationDepartedEvent, RelationJoinedEvent

class MyPool(StatusPool):
    workload = Status()


class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, framework, key=None):
        super().__init__(framework, key)
        self.status_pool = MyPool(self)
        self.framework.observe(self.on.workload_pebble_ready,
                               self._workload_ready)
        self.framework.observe(self.on.foo_relation_joined,
                               self._foo_relation_joined)
        self.framework.observe(self.on.foo_relation_changed,
                               self._foo_relation_changed)
        self.framework.observe(self.on.foo_relation_departed,
                               self._foo_relation_departed)

    def _workload_ready(self, evt):
        # do your thing
        self.status_pool.workload = ActiveStatus()

    def _foo_relation_joined(self, event:RelationJoinedEvent):
        remote_unit_name = event.unit  # the unit that just joined
        identifier = remote_unit_name.replace('/', '_')
        status = Status(tag=remote_unit_name)
        self.status_pool.add_status(status, identifier)
        
        # from now on you can:
        stat = getattr(self.status_pool, identifier)
        assert stat is status
        
    def _foo_relation_changed(self, event):
        for remote_unit in event.relation.units:
            identifier = remote_unit.name.replace('/', '_')
            
            # you can access the 'previous' status:
            # same as: getattr(self.status_pool, identifier)
            previous_status = self.status_pool.get_status(identifier)
            print(previous_status)
            
            # for example
            new_status = WaitingStatus('this relation is waiting')
            previous_status.warning('waiting because...')
            
            # and then you can
            self.status_pool.set_status(identifier, new_status)
            # same as: setattr(self.status_pool, identifier, new_status)
            
    def _foo_relation_departed(self, event: RelationDepartedEvent):
        remote_unit_name = event.departing_unit.name
        identifier = remote_unit_name.replace('/', '_')
        current_status = self.status_pool.get_status(identifier)
        if current_status.status == 'blocked':
            current_status.error(
                'This unit departed while the relation status was blocked;' 
                'this means very bad things.')
        # forget about this status:
        self.status_pool.remove_status(current_status)
```
